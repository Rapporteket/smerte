#' Provide reports according to subscription
#'
#' When called, typically through a chain of events initiated by a chron
#' process, this is the function that actually produces the report to be
#' shiped off to the recipient. The actual call to this function is made
#' through do.call and has the effect of providing the parameters as class
#' \emph{list}. Hence, values must be extracted by list operations.
#'
#' @param baseName Single element list with value of Rmd template for the report.
#' Value must be provided without the file extention (\emph{i.e.} ".Rmd")
#' @param reshId Single element list with the organization id of the subscriber
#' as its value
#' @param registryName Single element list which value is the regisry name
#' @param author Single element list holding the name of the subscriber as its
#' value
#' @param hospitalName Single element list with a (human readable) org name as
#' its value
#' @param type Single element list which value defining report file format,
#' currently one of "pdf" or "html"
#'
#' @return Full path of file produced
#' @export
